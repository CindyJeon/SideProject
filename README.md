# SideProject 
Mia, Sadhna, and I created a business scenario for Lux, an imaginary consumer electronics company. 
Web scraping weather data can be a solution to their business problem by allowing them to prepare for potential delivery disruptions.

1) Business Scenario : Lux's new product line targets luxury appliance buyers. Real-time weather data (OpenWeatherMap + web scraping) is used to adjust deliveries (MongoDB) to avoid extreme weather disruptions.
2) Data Sources : OpenWeatherMap ("https://openweathermap.org/") 
3) Web-Scraping methods
Step 1: Autonomous login and Configure "Selenium WebDriver" for dynamic content loading to save HTML pages
Step 2: Set up "BeautifulSoup" for HTML content parsing. Useful for extracting specific information from static web pages.
Step 3: Identify and register for APIs providing real-time and historical weather data, and store scraped data in a preliminary format for further processing (use MongoDB,JSON)
